# Analysis-of-Imbalance-Datasets

Investigate the extent of class imbalance in the dataset and understand the
implications it has on the machine learning problem at hand.
Explore the various evaluation metrics suitable for assessing model performance
on imbalanced data, such as precision, recall. Apply preprocessing techniques aimed at solving the effects of class imbalance,
such as cost-sensitive, oversampling, undersampling, or a combination of
both(ensemble learning), and assess their impact on model performance.
